      content="Participate is an opensource civic-education and engagement platform that will provide information on every level of government of the United States in one ubiquitous location. The focal point of the UI is an intuitive, interactive map which people can use to select the government they are interested in. Initially, Participate will fulfill two primary functions:
      1. Provide information on all upcoming elections, and create a space to list and describe all candidates running in respective elections.
      2. Provide comprehensive data on current government (structure, jurisdiction, employees, contact information, events, opportunities to engage, etc.) in a simple and intuitive manner.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
