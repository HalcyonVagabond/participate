The focal point of the UI is an intuitive, interactive map which people can use to select the government they are interested in. Initially, Participate will fulfill two primary functions:
      1. Provide information on all upcoming elections, and create a space to list and describe all candidates running in respective elections.
      2. Provide comprehensive data on current government (structure, jurisdiction, employees, contact information, events, opportunities to engage, etc.) in a simple and intuitive manner.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
