Hello! This is the repository for the demo of Particpate; my front-end demo and side project. 

Participate is an open source civic education and engagement platform. We want to encourage and empower you to get back into your own life and community by providing easy access to information about your local governments, institutions, and systems.

Explore the different governments of the United States via our intuitive map system, or by searching for them directly in the map toolbar. Explore the rest of the site via the Navigation Bar.

Have fun, learn something new, and go Participate!

Participate is a work in progress (literally and metaphorically). If you are a developer or have developing skills, please consider contributing to this open source project.


***This project is built with React. If you clone or fork, run the npm install command.***
